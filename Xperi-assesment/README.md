Hi Ping

Design a token management system for a grocery store issuing tokens to customers who want to visit the store in next x-y days. 
Token is basically a time slot when a user can visit that store. 
This management system should be extendible to be used for other services like Gym, Swimming Pool, Saloon, etc. 


Grocery store
Slot should be pre-avilable
If book successful

REST API

Public interface Token Mgmt {
checkForAvailableSlot();
}


Public class slot {

pul

}

Slot is timing - 1hr
Slot size - 5 booking
Future days - 7 days

Open timing -  
Close timing - 
No holidays
