Employee Management Requirements
Save data for Employee, Department, Project
A department can have one or more Projects
A project belongs to only one Department
A department can have one or more Employees
An employee can be part of one or more Departments.
An employee can be part of one or more project across different departments provided they are part of that project’s department.
All need to be identified by a “code” say for example Department - rotor, wheel, Project – fin, req, Employee – E1001, E1002, etc. This code is provided by a user during creation and not auto generated.
But project code is not unique on its own, the combination of department code and project code makes it unique
