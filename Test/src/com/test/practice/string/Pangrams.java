    /**
     * A pangram is a sentence that contains all 26 letters of the English alphabet.
     * One of the most well-known examples of a pangram is, “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.”
     * Create a pangram checker that returns a Boolean TRUE if an input string is a pangram and FALSE if it isn’t.
     *
     * For an added pangram challenge, create a perfect pangram checker. A perfect pangram is a sentence that
     * uses each letter of the alphabet only once, such as, “Mr. Jock, TV quiz Ph.D., bags few lynx.”
