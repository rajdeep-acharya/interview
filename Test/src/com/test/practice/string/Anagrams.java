    /**
     * Two words are anagrams if they contain the same letters but in a different order. Here are a few examples
     * of anagram pairs:

     * “listen” and “silent”
     * “binary” and “brainy”
     * “Paris” and “pairs”
     * For a given input of two strings, return a Boolean TRUE if the two strings are anagrams.

     * As an added challenge, for a given array of strings, return separate lists that group anagrams together.
     * For example, the input {“tar,” “rat,” “art,” “meats,” “steam”}, the output should look something like
     * {[“tar,” “rat,” “art”], [“meats,” “steam”]}.
