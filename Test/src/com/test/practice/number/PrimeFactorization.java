    /**
     * The prime factors of a number are all the integers below that number that are divisible into
     * the number as well as 1. For example, the prime factors of 12 are 1,2,3,4,6, and 12.
     *
     * Create a prime factorization calculator that returns the prime factors of any number between
     * 2 and 100. If you're looking for a more advanced version of this challenge, use exercise 9 to
     * create a prime factorization calculator for any number. Hint: think about using square roots to
     * cut your work in half.
