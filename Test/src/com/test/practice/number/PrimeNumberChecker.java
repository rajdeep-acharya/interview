    /**
     * A prime number is any whole number greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and itself.
     * For example, 7 is a prime number because itâ€™s only divisible by 1 and 7.
     *
     * Create a function that returns TRUE if an input number is prime. The first few prime
     * numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19.
     *
     * For a slightly harder challenge, create a prime number calculator that outputs all prime
     * numbers between 2 and the input number.
