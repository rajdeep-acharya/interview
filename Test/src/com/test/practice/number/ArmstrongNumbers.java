    /**
     * An Armstrong number is a whole number that’s equal to the sum of its digits raised to the power of
     * the total number of digits. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because there are three digits,
     * and 153 = 13 + 53 + 33. The four-digit number 8208 is also an Armstrong number, as 8208 = 84 + 24 + 04 + 84.
     *
     * Create an Armstrong number checker that returns a Boolean TRUE if the input number is an Armstrong number.
     * Hint: to extract each digit from a given number, try using the remainder/modulo operator.
     *
     * If you’re looking for something a little more challenging, create an Armstrong number calculator that
     * returns all Armstrong numbers between 0 and the input number.
