Instructions

•Ensure that the code is well commented and is object oriented

•You need to make sure that the code not only works for the test cases described below but also for other datasets and test cases. Ensure that boundary conditions are taken care of.

•Adding unit tests is nice to have, not mandatory

•All the best!

 

Programming Test

Best Buy Baby Products Program

Write a program that accepts a price file of baby products(format below) as CSV file, and a list of products that someone wants to buy, and outputs the shop they should go to, and the total price it will cost them.  It is okay to purchase extra products, as long as the total cost is minimized.

 

price file format

shop ID, price, product 1 label (single product)

shop ID, price, product 1 label, product 2 label, ... (combo packs with multiple products)

 

Shop IDs are integers, all products are lower case letters and underscores, and the price is a decimal number.
