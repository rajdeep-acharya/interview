A big food chain wants to develop a platform which can be used by thousands of customers to order a customized burger with their choice of ingredients. Customer should be able to choose from pre-defined ingredients:
Type of bunSaladCheese Burger patty
The price of burger should be dynamically calculated based on the ingredients chosen by the customer. Price can also vary based on the customer location.
While the company will like to track the mode of payment (credit, debit, bitcoin) but it will not like to handle the customers card information.

Food chain is also expecting that once they go online their customer base will increase 10 folds. 

Problem 1: 
Provide a blueprint for the platform, identify the services required to meet the requirements. The integration mechanism also needs to be defined. 
The food chain already has many such platforms for other purposes, their tech team primarily uses Java.
